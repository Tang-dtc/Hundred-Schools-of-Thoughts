<h2>The digital research of the ancient Chinese literature</h2>

My Postgraduate dissertation at King's College London is using the digital lexical analysis tool to explore the main thought in the Hundred Schools of Thought. This research applies THU lexical Analyser for Chinese (THULAC) and Word Cloud in Python to analyse the content of these pieces of literature. The counting of word frequency can give guidance for us to analyse the main thought of these works.
